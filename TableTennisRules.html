          The official rulebook for table tennis, also known as ping pong, is
          maintained by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). The
          current version of the rulebook, which came into effect on September
          1, 2021, can be found on the ITTF website.

            >Here are some of the most important rules in table tennis:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &#x2022; The game is played on a table that is 2.74 meters long,
            1.525 meters wide, and 76 cm high. The table is divided into two
            halves by a net that is 15.25 cm high.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#x2022; The ball must be made of celluloid and must be a standard
            size and weight.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#x2022; A game is played to 11 points, and a player must win by a
            two-point margin.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#x2022; The serve must start with the ball resting on the open palm
            of the server's hand and must be thrown up at least 16 cm. The ball
            must then hit the server's half of the table, cross the net, and
            land on the receiver's half of the table.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#x2022; The rally continues until a player fails to return the ball
            correctly, hits the ball out of bounds, or commits a fault.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#x2022; Points can be scored by either player, and the player who
            scores a point serves for the next point.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#x2022; A player can change their playing hand during a match, but
            they must inform the umpire and their opponent before doing so.
          </li>
        </ul>

          These are just some of the most important rules in table tennis, and
          the ITTF rulebook goes into much greater detail on how the game should
          be played. I would recommend reviewing the full rulebook if you are
          interested in playing the game competitively.
